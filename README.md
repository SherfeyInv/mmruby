## mmruby

mmruby is an alternative mruby implementation which is:

- Small foot print
  - ROM: 256KB or less
  - RAM: 128KB or less
- Portable
  - Depends on only standard C library such as glibc, Newlib or Newlib-nano

### Set-up

- mmrbc
  - mini mruby compiler. The main part of this repository
- [mruby/c (mrubyc/mrubyc)](https://github.com/mrubyc/mrubyc)
  - Another implementation of mruby virtual machine

### Build

- Just hitting `make` will build binaries for your host machine.
- You can build library files for PSoC5LP by hitting `make psoc5lp_lib`
  - It requires you to have Docker though,
  - You can make arm-none-eabi tools if you don't want to use Docker
  - [hasumikin/cross_compilation_toolchains](https://github.com/hasumikin/cross_compilation_toolchains) may help you to make an environment

### Binaries

`make` command will make three executable binaries

- mmrbc
  - `build/host-debug/bin/mmrbc source.rb` makes `source.mrb` which is VM code runs on mruby VM
- mmruby
  - `build/host-debug/bin/mmruby source.rb` executes Ruby just like normal `ruby` command
  - You can also do like `build/host-debug/bin/mmruby -e 'puts "Hello World!"'`
- mmirb
  - It is an experimental REPL implementation. See [mmirb section](#mmirb)

### Debug build and production build

`make` command makes "debug build" which shows debug-print like this:

You can get "production build" like `build/host-production/bin/mmruby` which omits debug-print by `make host_production`

### mmirb<a name="mmirb"></a>

Because mmruby is dedicated for onechip-microcontroller which doesn't have STDIN/STDOUT like *normal computers*, REPL (or you can also say SHELL) should work over serial communication like UART.

You can start up mmirb on your host machine with `make mmirb` though, it may look weird since it is implemented as a ported version from microcontroller version.
Please try to use it according as the message on the screen if you are intersted in.

### Presentation about mmruby

I gave a talk about this project on [RubyKaigi Takeout 2020](https://rubykaigi.org/2020-takeout).

### Roadmap

mmruby is still developing halfway towards finishing as of 2020.

See implementation roadmap on [issue/6](https://github.com/hasumikin/mmruby/issues/6)
